Coming up with a new, intuitive solution to interaction between humans and modern day machines. As of late, machines viz. Mobile phones, laptops, computers have become the primary source of gathering information. But, these machines have their own limitations like being restricted to 2-D outputs and necessity of physical interaction with the machine.  
Any computer system has three parts viz., input, output and processing. In our solution, we aim to take input through human gestures, output through augmented reality and processing through Raspberry Pi (a single board  computer).
This new form of User interface can be relevant in several conditions. But, in our prototype, we will look forward to provide media player, document reader along with meaning of words, OCR,  answer to some scanned questions, etc., emphasizing on the smart education side of the project.
