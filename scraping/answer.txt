 Solution :  In Fig, a charge `q = 8 mC = 8xx10^(-3)C` is located at the origin O, charge to be carried is  `q_(0) = -2xx10^(-9)C`, from p to Q  Where `OP = r_(p) = 3 cm = 3xx10^(-2) m`  and `OQ = r_(Q) = 4cm = 4xx10^(-2) m`  As electrostatic forces are conervative forces, work done is independent of the path. Therefore, there si no relevance of point R.  `W_(PQ) = q_(0) (V_(Q) - V_(P))`  `W_(PQ) = (qq_(0))/(4pi in_(0)) ((1)/(r_(Q)) - (1)/(r_(p)))`  `= 9xx10^(9)xx8xx10^(-3) (-2xx10^(-9)) [(1)/(4xx10^(-2)) - (1)/(3xx10^(-2))]`  `= -144xx10^(-3)xx10^(2) (- (1)/(12)) = 1.2 joul e`  <img src="https://d10lpgp6xz60nq.cloudfront.net/physics_images/PR_XII_V01_C01_S01_581_S01.png" width="80%">
